Hundreds of new notifications everyday, lots of them are redundant (i.e. the same question added to several topics i follow or x number of people added an answer to a question i follow).

However, some guy apparently ported that with some fixes into a Chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quora-extender/ljefnhagdgpochbjiiknhflemdnnlebh?hl=en">Quora Extender</a>. Although it does a good job in combining the notifications, my comments are:</p> <ul> <li>I don’t like the approach for the interface and packing of elements together</li> <li>They don’t catch new notification fetched by the Quora infinite Scroll</li> <li>They don’t provide any clustering for notifications</li> <li>I cannot easily navigate through topics by any kind of filters</li> </ul> <p><a class="btn btn_success" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doeadnmeadgfgcgplbnibocnkkngddeb">Download</a></p> <h3 id="discussions-about-the-issue">Discussions about the issue</h3> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.quora.com/Improving-Quora-Notifications">Improving Quora Notifications</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.quora.com/Notifications-on-Quora/Can-Quora-let-me-filter-out-board-notifications-from-all-the-other-ones">Can Quora let me filter out board notifications from all the other ones?</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.quora.com/Notifications-on-Quora">Notifications on Quora</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.quora.com/Notifications-on-Quora/How-could-Quora-improve-notifications?share=1">How could Quora improve notifications ?</a></li> </ul> <p>I have decided that this has to end, i want to better view my notifications. This extension is a simple one. It can identify several actions in the notifications feed:</p> <figure> <a href="/images/posts/quora-better-notification.png"><img src="/images/posts/quora-better-notification.png" alt="" /></a> <figcaption>Quora Better Notifications (QBN) Chrome Extension</figcaption> </figure> <ul> <li>New question added to a topic you follow</li> <li>Replies to a some action you posted</li> <li>Comments on one of your posts</li> <li>Comments on one of your answers</li> <li>Suggested edit to question</li> <li>Asked you to answer a question</li> <li>Mentioned you in a post</li> <li>Wrote an answer for a question you follow</li> <li>Promoted a question you asked</li> <li>You have a new follower to one for your blogs</li> <li>You have a new follower to one of your questions</li> <li>You have a new user following you</li> <li>Voted up an answer for you on some question</li> <li>Thanked you for an answer or contribution</li> <li>Tweeted about some of your content</li> <li>Suggested to edit your bio</li> </ul> <p>After Catching these notifications, i have hacked the sidebar and presented these as filters with a counter for the new ones. But doing only that is not enough for me at this point, i wanted to do some kind of clustering for some of the notification types.</p> <h2 id="notifications-clustering">Notifications Clustering</h2> <p>At the current version of the extension i only cluster two types of notifications:</p> <ul> <li><strong>New Answer Notification</strong>: Instead of having multiple entries for answers added to a question i follow, they are now clustered like User(X) and (N) others posted an answer to question you follow.</li> <li><strong>New Questions added to a Topic: </strong>It happens very often that a single question is added to multiple categories, they are now clustered like Question(X) has been added to (N) Topics : (Topic1, Topic2 … TopicN)</li> </ul> <h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3> <p>I am planning to finish clustering for all the other actions. For example, the upVoting notification will be clustered in a similar fashion to Twitter’s notification: User(X) and (N) others voted up your answer …</p> <h2 id="topics-filtering">Topics Filtering</h2> <p>If you are following lots of topics, you might be interested at some point to browse only a certain topic. For that, there is a dropdown list in the top that contains a list of all the topics (fine-grained list i.e. if there is a context found in a certain topic, the context is presented) discovered in the feed.</p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <ul> <li>Quora implements an infinite scroll mechanism to fetch new notifications. I had problems trying to catch when an infinite call is done as it is not done via a normal AJAX request as i could not intercept that by assigning a hook on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ajax.success()</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">ajax.complete()</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">document</code>. So at the moment, there is function that runs on intervals of 5 seconds that will check for new notifications fetched by Quora and then applies the clustering and cleaning.</li> <li>This is a very early prototype that was during a weekend, so please try it out and i will appreciate any feedback</li> <li>I will be keen on porting this plugin into a Bookmarklet if requested</li> </ul> <p><a class="btn btn_success" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doeadnmeadgfgcgplbnibocnkkngddeb">Download</a></p> <br> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://127.0.0.1:4000/quora-better-notifications/" class="btn btn_twitter" title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Twitter</span></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://127.0.0.1:4000/quora-better-notifications/" class="btn btn_facebook" title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Facebook</span></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://127.0.0.1:4000/quora-better-notifications/" class="btn btn_google-plus" title="Share on Google Plus"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-google-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Google+</span></a> </div> <nav class="pagination"> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rdf/" class="pagination_pager" title="Everything you need to know about RDF ">previous</a> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/rubix-a-framework-for-improving-data-integration-with-linked-data/" class="pagination_pager" title="RUBIX ">next</a> </nav> <script src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/assets/js/build/main.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script> <!-- Asynchronous Google Analytics snippet --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-11075253-1', 'auto'); ga('require', 'linkid', 'linkid.js'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <div class="overlay"> <ul class="projects-menu"> <li style="background:url(http://taylantatli.me/Halve/images/halve-home-image.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Halve" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Halve Jekyll Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Moon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Moon Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Ramme/master/assets/img/screenshot-post.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Ramme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Ramme Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/master/Preview-1.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Daisy Pelican Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme/master/Preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Block Icon Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/StartPage/master/preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/StartPage/" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Start Page <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </body> </html>
