Blog
========
The new version of the blog contains the SMARTY PHP template engine and MVC like pattern. This provides much cleaner way to code in WordPress.

**Configuration**

The most important part is to configure correctly the SMARTY template engine. For the ease of work, i have already shipped SMARTY library files with the code itself, so no need to externally download it. Just edit the paths in `functions.php` to match the desired location (there are three template locations already set)

**Notes**
 - Make sure to already clear the cache files to avoid wrong URLs saved in the transients
 - There are a set of plugins needed for the template to work (YARPP and Organize Series)
